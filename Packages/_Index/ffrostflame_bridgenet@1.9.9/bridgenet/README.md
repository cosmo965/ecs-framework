## coming features:
- middleware and rate limiting. there's internal support right now, but I delayed it for a later date due to some architecture concerns.
- typechecking

## For contributors
Please add your changes to CHANGELOG.md when you make a PR, it makes it a lot easier on me to make new releases and prevents a lot of confusion.
